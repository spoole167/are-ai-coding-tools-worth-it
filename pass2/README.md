Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is deceptively simple: write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station. There’s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows!

The text file has a simple structure with one measurement value per row:
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
…
Note that records that begin with a hash (‘#’) are to treated as comments and ignored.

The program should print out the min, mean, and max values per station, alphabetically ordered like so:
{Abha=5.0/18.0/27.4, Abidjan=15.7/26.0/34.1, Abéché=12.1/29.4/35.6, Accra=14.7/26.4/33.1, Addis Ababa=2.1/16.0/24.3, Adelaide=4.1/17.3/29.7, ...}

The goal of the 1BRC challenge is to create the fastest implementation for this task, and while doing so, explore the benefits of modern Java and find out how far you can push this platform. So grab all your (virtual) threads, reach out to the Vector API and SIMD, optimize your GC, leverage AOT compilation, or pull any other trick you can think of.

There’s a few simple rules of engagement for 1BRC 
Any submission must be written in Java
No external dependencies may be used
There must be a comment to identify the version of Java being used.
The input file name will be provided as the first argument on the command line
Make sure all Java code includes all necessary import statements.
Give the class a one word package name based on  your name
Include Javadoc and other comments to explain what the program does

# Analysis of Temperature Processing Java Programs

This document provides an analysis and comparison of four Java programs designed to process temperature data files, each calculating the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures per weather station and outputting results in a formatted manner.

## General Overview
Each program reads a large text file of temperature records, calculates statistics for each weather station, and outputs the results.

## Individual Program Analysis

### 1. `Amazon_Q_Dev_TemperatureAnalyzer.java`
- **Performance**: 
  - Uses a `TreeMap` for storing data, ensuring sorted output but resulting in `O(log n)` insertion complexity. 
  - Efficient for moderate-sized datasets but may be slower for extremely large datasets.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Proper handling for `IOException` but lacks `NumberFormatException` handling, risking runtime issues on malformed data.
- **Efficiency**: 
  - Single-threaded, which may limit performance on large datasets.
- **Improvements**: 
  - Add `NumberFormatException` handling for robustness.
  - Introduce parallel processing for enhanced performance with large data files.

---

### 2. `MS_CoPilot_TemperatureProcessor.java`
- **Performance**: 
  - Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` and parallel streams for reading and processing lines, optimizing for large datasets through multi-threaded execution.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Comprehensive, including `NumberFormatException` handling to skip malformed data gracefully.
- **Efficiency**: 
  - Highly efficient due to parallel processing, with synchronized lists ensuring thread safety.
- **Improvements**: 
  - Consider alternatives like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` to reduce overhead if read operations dominate.

---

### 3. `ChatGPT_TemperatureAnalyzer.java`
- **Performance**: 
  - Utilizes `MappedByteBuffer` and `ForkJoinPool` for parallel processing, making it suitable for extremely large files by reducing I/O overhead.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Includes handling for `IOException` and `NumberFormatException`, ensuring robust data processing.
- **Efficiency**: 
  - High efficiency from memory-mapped files and parallel execution.
- **Improvements**: 
  - Monitor memory usage to avoid `OutOfMemoryError` when processing files larger than available RAM.

---

### 4. `Codium_OneBillionRowChallenge.java`
- **Performance**: 
  - Uses `HashMap` for `O(1)` insertion and a `TreeMap` for sorting after processing, which is efficient for moderate data sizes.
  - Performance may be limited without parallelism for very large datasets.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Adequate, with handling for `IOException` and invalid temperature parsing.
- **Efficiency**: 
  - Limited by single-threaded processing.
- **Improvements**: 
  - Introduce parallel processing for improved handling of large datasets.
